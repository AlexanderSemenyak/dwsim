//An Implementation of IAPWS-IF97 Steam Tables

//The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam Properties published IAPWS-IF97.
//The formulation can be obtained from http://www.iapws.org or from ASME publication, ASME
//International Steam Tables for Industrial Use, 2nd Edition.

//There are several software based on IAPWS formulation (follow the links from, http://www.iapws.org ).
//This is yet another implementation not affiliated with IAPWS.
